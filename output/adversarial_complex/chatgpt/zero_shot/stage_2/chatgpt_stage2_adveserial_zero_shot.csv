Janet was shopping for music online and bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each song was on average 12 minutes long. Each album had 9 songs and came with a lyric sheet. The first two albums took 80 minutes each to listen through. How many songs did Janet buy total? ,72,"Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums, so she bought a total of 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 albums.
Each album has 9 songs, so the total number of songs is 8 x 9 = <<89=72>>72 songs.
Since each song is on average 12 minutes long, the total listening time for the songs is 72 x 12 = <<7212=864>>864 minutes.
The first two albums took 80 minutes each to listen through, so their total listening time is 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160 minutes.
Therefore, Janet bought a total of 72 + 160 = <<72+160=232>>232 songs."
"Lana was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 4 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. The mittens were bought at 2 dollars per pair, but are now sold at a higher price, so Lana could possibly earn 25 dollars from the sale. She however decided to donate some of the clothes to the homeless shelter. After donating, there were 3 boxes left with 4 scarves and 7 mittens in each box, which could be sold for a total of 80 dollars.  How many pieces of winter clothing did Lana have before donating? ",32,"
Let's break down the information given step by step:

Initially, Lana found 4 boxes of clothing. Each box contained 2 scarves and 6 mittens. So the total number of scarves in those boxes is 4 boxes * 2 scarves = 8 scarves. Similarly, the total number of mittens is 4 boxes * 6 mittens = 24 mittens.

Next, we are told that Lana could earn 25 dollars from the sale of the mittens. Since each pair of mittens is sold at 2 dollars, the total number of pairs of mittens Lana has is 25 dollars / 2 dollars = 12.5 pairs. Since we can't have a fraction of a pair, let's assume Lana has 12 pairs of mittens.

After donating, Lana is left with 3 boxes. Each of these boxes contains 4 scarves and 7 mittens. So the total number of scarves in these boxes is 3 boxes * 4 scarves = 12 scarves. Similarly, the total number of mittens is 3 boxes * 7 mittens = 21 mittens.

We are also told that these remaining scarves and mittens could be sold for a total of 80 dollars.

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces Lana had before donating, we need to sum up the scarves and mittens from both before and after donating.

Total scarves = 8 scarves (initially) + 12 scarves (after donating) = 20 scarves.
Total mittens = 24 mittens (initially) + 12 pairs * 2 mittens per pair + 21 mittens (after donating) = 69 mittens.

Therefore, Lana had a total of 20 scarves + 69 mittens = 89 pieces of winter clothing before donating."
"At the pet shelter, there were 3 puppies weighing 5 lbs each. Another 3 puppies were brought in, and they weighed 10 lbs each. Now there are a total of 6 puppies at the shelter. the total weight went up to 80 pounds by the addition of 2 full grown dogs. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all puppies to be adopted? ",2,"Initially, there were 3 puppies weighing 5 lbs each, so the total weight of these puppies is 3 puppies * 5 lbs/puppy = 15 lbs.

Then, another 3 puppies were brought in, and they weighed 10 lbs each. So the total weight of the new puppies is 3 puppies * 10 lbs/puppy = 30 lbs.

Now there are a total of 6 puppies at the shelter, so the total weight of all the puppies is 15 lbs + 30 lbs = 45 lbs.

Additionally, 2 full-grown dogs were added, and they increased the total weight to 80 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the 2 full-grown dogs is 80 lbs - 45 lbs = 35 lbs.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to determine the number of days it would take to adopt 6 puppies, with 3 puppies being adopted per day.

The total number of puppies to be adopted is 6 puppies. If 3 puppies are adopted per day, it would take 6 puppies / 3 puppies/day = 2 days to adopt all the puppies.

Therefore, it would take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted."
"Sam, who has a habit of wearing short sleeve shirts, had to wash 40 of them. Then, he remembered that it was going to be colder outside. He decided to wear long sleeve shirts. He had 23 long sleeve shirts to wash as well. He has more long sleeve shirts in general than short sleeve ones. If he had only washed 29 of his shirts by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ",34,"Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts, so in total, he had 40 + 23 = 63 shirts to wash.

By the time school started, he had washed 29 shirts, so the number of shirts he did not wash is 63 - 29 = 34 shirts.

Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts."
"In the video game, each enemy defeated gives you 5 points. You start with 100 points. After defeating 20 enemies including the boss, you have 200 points.  If a level has 8 enemies total and you destroy all but 6 of them, how many points would you earn? ",10,"Let's break down the information given step by step:

Each enemy defeated gives you 5 points, and you start with 100 points.
After defeating 20 enemies, including the boss, you have 200 points.

To find the points earned per enemy defeated, we can subtract the initial points from the final points and divide it by the number of enemies defeated:
Points earned per enemy = (Final points - Initial points) / Number of enemies defeated
= (200 - 100) / 20
= 5 points

Now, we know that a level has 8 enemies total and you destroyed all but 6 of them.
So the number of enemies defeated is 8 - 6 = 2 enemies.

To find the points earned by defeating these 2 enemies, we can multiply the points earned per enemy by the number of enemies defeated:
Points earned = Points earned per enemy * Number of enemies defeated
= 5 points * 2 enemies
= 10 points

Therefore, you would earn 10 points by defeating the remaining 2 enemies.

"A toy store had 6 giant stuffed bears in stock. After receiving a new shipment, they now have 24 bears. Each bear weighs a pound. The store puts these bears onto shelves with 6 on each shelf. The shelf capacity is only 3 pounds, but it holds up to 10 pounds without breaking. How many shelves did they use? ",4,"The toy store initially had 6 giant stuffed bears in stock and received a new shipment, bringing the total number of bears to 24.

Since each bear weighs 1 pound, the total weight of the bears is 24 bears * 1 pound/bear = 24 pounds.

The shelf capacity is 3 pounds, but it can hold up to 10 pounds without breaking.

To determine the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total weight of the bears by the maximum weight capacity of each shelf (10 pounds) and round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of shelves used = Ceiling(total weight of bears / maximum weight capacity per shelf)

Number of shelves used = Ceiling(24 pounds / 10 pounds) = Ceiling(2.4) = 3

Therefore, the toy store used 3 shelves to accommodate all the bears."
"Oliver had 35 dollars in his wallet. On his birthday, he got 50 more dollars as a gift. He was very excited and decided to buy a new game that he had been wanting for a long time, along with some apples that cost 3 pounds per kilogram. The game cost him 84 dollars. Now he has 1.2 kilograms of apples in his backpack which he got for free. How much money does he have now? ",1,"Let's calculate Oliver's total money after each transaction:

Initially, Oliver had 35 dollars in his wallet.
After receiving 50 more dollars as a birthday gift, his total money becomes 35 dollars + 50 dollars = 85 dollars.

He then buys a game for 84 dollars. Therefore, his money is reduced to 85 dollars - 84 dollars = 1 dollar.

Additionally, he receives 1.2 kilograms of apples for free.

To determine the cost of the apples, we need to know the price per kilogram of apples. If the price is given, I can provide a more accurate calculation.

"In the video game, where each enemy defeated gives you 7 points, you currently have 56 points. After defeating 10 more enemies, you now have 126 points.  If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 8 of them, but you lose to the boss enemy worth double the points, how many points would you earn? ",21,"Let's break down the information given step by step:

Each enemy defeated gives you 7 points, and you currently have 56 points.
After defeating 10 more enemies, you now have 126 points.

To find the points earned per enemy defeated, we can subtract the initial points from the final points and divide it by the number of enemies defeated:
Points earned per enemy = (Final points - Initial points) / Number of enemies defeated
= (126 - 56) / 10
= 7 points

Now, we know that a level has 11 enemies total, and you destroyed all but 8 of them. So the number of enemies defeated is 11 - 8 = 3 enemies.

However, you mentioned losing to the boss enemy, which is worth double the points. So, the boss enemy would give you 7 points * 2 = 14 points.

To find the total points earned, we can multiply the points earned per regular enemy by the number of regular enemies defeated and add the points earned from defeating the boss enemy:
Total points earned = (Points earned per enemy * Number of regular enemies defeated) + Points earned from defeating the boss enemy
= (7 points * 3 enemies) + 14 points
= 21 points + 14 points
= 35 points

Therefore, you would earn 35 points in total by defeating the regular enemies and the boss enemy.

"The waiter had 9 tables he was waiting on, with 7 women and 3 men at each table. The men's food weighed an average of 80 grams per plate, while the women's food weighed 60 grams per plate. The waiter carried 340 kilogram worth of food to the nearest table. How many customers total did the waiter have? ",90,"The waiter had 9 tables he was waiting on, with 7 women and 3 men at each table. So, the total number of customers at each table is 7 women + 3 men = 10 customers.

To find the total number of customers, we need to multiply the number of customers per table (10 customers) by the number of tables (9 tables):
Total number of customers = Customers per table * Number of tables
= 10 customers * 9 tables
= 90 customers

Now let's calculate the total weight of the food carried by the waiter, which is 340 kilograms.

The men's food weighed an average of 80 grams per plate, so the total weight of the men's food can be calculated by multiplying the number of men (3 men) by the weight per plate (80 grams):
Total weight of men's food = Number of men * Weight per plate
= 3 men * 80 grams
= 240 grams

The women's food weighed an average of 60 grams per plate, so the total weight of the women's food can be calculated by multiplying the number of women (7 women) by the weight per plate (60 grams):
Total weight of women's food = Number of women * Weight per plate
= 7 women * 60 grams
= 420 grams

Now, we need to convert the total weights of the men's and women's food to kilograms:
Total weight of men's food (in kilograms) = 240 grams / 1000 (conversion to kilograms)
= 0.24 kilograms

Total weight of women's food (in kilograms) = 420 grams / 1000 (conversion to kilograms)
= 0.42 kilograms

Finally, to check if the total weight matches the weight carried by the waiter, we can add the weights of the men's and women's food:
Total weight of food = Total weight of men's food + Total weight of women's food
= 0.24 kilograms + 0.42 kilograms
= 0.66 kilograms

Since the total weight of the food carried by the waiter is 340 kilograms, it doesn't match the calculated weight of 0.66 kilograms. There might be an error in the given information or calculations."
"The fashion designer used 4 feet of cotton to make a tee-shirt. After washing it in hot water, the tee-shirt shrank from its original size of 36 inches to 30 inches.  How many tee-shirts can be made with 60 feet of material?",15,"The fashion designer used 4 feet of cotton to make a tee-shirt, and after washing, the tee-shirt shrank from 36 inches to 30 inches.

To calculate how many tee-shirts can be made with 60 feet of material, we need to determine how much material is needed for each tee-shirt.

Since the tee-shirt shrank from 36 inches to 30 inches, the amount of material needed for one tee-shirt is 36 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length from inches to feet, as we have 60 feet of material:
1 foot = 12 inches

So, 36 inches is equal to 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3 feet.

Therefore, each tee-shirt requires 3 feet of material.

To calculate the number of tee-shirts that can be made with 60 feet of material, we divide the total material by the material needed per tee-shirt:
Number of tee-shirts = Total material / Material needed per tee-shirt
= 60 feet / 3 feet
= 20 tee-shirts

Hence, with 60 feet of material, the fashion designer can make 20 tee-shirts.

Before the change, the waiter took 5 minutes to serve each customer. After the change, he now takes 4 minutes to serve each customer.

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.

Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 27 (given)

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip

"For Halloween, Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. Her blood sugar was at 12 percent. After eating 12 pieces, she placed the rest into piles with 5 in each pile. She ended up with a blood sugar of 25 percent. How many piles could she make? ",4,"Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. After eating 12 pieces, she had 32 - 12 = 20 pieces of candy remaining.

She placed the remaining candy into piles with 5 pieces in each pile. Let's denote the number of piles she could make as ""p"".

The total number of candy pieces in the piles is then p * 5.

Her blood sugar was initially at 12 percent and ended up at 25 percent after eating the candy.

To determine the number of piles, we need to set up the following equation:

12% of 32 + 25% of (p * 5) = total number of candy pieces

0.12 * 32 + 0.25 * (p * 5) = 20

3.84 + 1.25p = 20

1.25p = 20 - 3.84

1.25p = 16.16

p = 16.16 / 1.25

In October, he saved an additional $49, so his total savings became $30 + $49 = $79.

In November, he saved another $46, making his total savings $79 + $46 = $125.

However, Johnny spent $58 on a video game, so his remaining savings are $125 - $58 = $67.

In September, Johnny did not put any money in a savings account, so there was no interest earned.

In October, he also did not put any money in a savings account, so there was no interest earned.

In November, Johnny had $125 in savings, and the interest rate was 5 percent per annum. So, the interest earned for that month would be (5/100) * $125 = $6.25.

However, because Johnny spent $58 on the video game, the interest rate he would receive fell to 1 percent. So, the interest earned for November would be (1/100) * ($125 - $58) = $0.67.

He then decided to play 'basketball toss' and managed to score 10 points out of 15. 8 points at 'basketball toss' are equivalent to 100 points in 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' combined. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 4 tickets a piece, how many could he buy? ",2,"Edward won 3 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 5 tickets playing 'skee ball'. He then scored 10 points in 'basketball toss' out of 15, and 8 points in 'basketball toss' are equivalent to 100 points in 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' combined.

Let's first calculate the total number of tickets Edward earned from 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball':

Total tickets from 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' = 3 tickets + 5 tickets = 8 tickets

Since 8 points in 'basketball toss' are equivalent to 100 points in 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' combined, we can set up the following proportion:

8 points / 15 points = 100 points / x tickets

Cross-multiplying, we get:

8x = 100 * 15
8x = 1500
x = 1500 / 8
x ≈ 187.5

Since we can't have fractional tickets, we can consider that Edward has 187 tickets.

Now, let's calculate the number of candies Edward can buy. If each candy costs 4 tickets, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets per candy:

Number of candies Edward can buy = Total tickets / Tickets per candy
= 187 tickets / 4 tickets per candy
≈ 46.75

Since we can't have a fractional number of candies, Edward can buy a maximum of 46 candies.

Therefore, Edward can buy 46 candies with his tickets."
"Manuel opened a savings account with an initial deposit of 177 dollars. When he initially deposited the money, his score was 20 percent less than the class average. At the end of 19 weeks, he must score 80 percent or he will lose his money. If he wants to save 500 dollars during the next 19 weeks , how much must he save each week , in dollars?",17,"Let's break down the information given:

Manuel's initial deposit was $177, and it was 20 percent less than the class average.
At the end of 19 weeks, he must save a total of $500.
To find out how much Manuel needs to save each week, we can start by calculating the class average based on his initial deposit.

Let's assume the class average is represented by ""x"" dollars.

The initial deposit of $177 is 20 percent less than the class average, which can be expressed as:

177 = (1 - 0.20) * x
177 = 0.80 * x

Now we can solve for x:

x = 177 / 0.80
x ≈ 221.25

The class average is approximately $221.25.

Since Manuel wants to save a total of $500 over 19 weeks, we can calculate how much he needs to save each week:

Amount to save each week = Total amount to save / Number of weeks
= $500 / 19
≈ $26.32

Therefore, Manuel needs to save approximately $26.32 each week in order to reach his goal of saving $500 in 19 weeks."
"Tom bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 8 to his little brother. Each box originally weighed 20 grams each.

If the total weight of the remaining chocolate candy is close to 80 grams, it means the pieces have become lighter. Let's assume the average weight of each remaining piece is x grams.

The number of remaining pieces can be calculated as follows:

Number of remaining pieces = Total weight of remaining chocolate candy / Average weight per piece
