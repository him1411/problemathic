"My car, which gets 20 miles for each gallon, can travel up to 400 miles on a full tank of gas. After driving for 3 hours, the gas gauge shows that the tank is now at 1/4 capacity.  How many miles can I drive on 5 gallons of gas?",100,"If your car gets 20 miles for each gallon of gas, and it can travel up to 400 miles on a full tank, it means that your car's tank capacity is 20 gallons (400 miles divided by 20 miles per gallon).

After driving for 3 hours, the gas gauge shows that the tank is now at 1/4 capacity. Since the tank has a total capacity of 20 gallons, 1/4 of that capacity would be 1/4 * 20 = 5 gallons.

Therefore, if you have 5 gallons of gas, you can expect to drive a distance of 5 gallons * 20 miles per gallon = 100 miles."
"In the barn, which is 800 square feet, there are 64 pigs. Some more came to join them. Now the barn size has been increased to 1200 square feet to accommodate 86 pigs. How many pigs came to join  them?",22,"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the increase in barn size and the increase in the number of pigs.

Let's denote the number of additional pigs that came to join as ""x.""

The initial barn size is 800 square feet, and the initial number of pigs is 64.
The increased barn size is 1200 square feet, and the increased number of pigs is 86.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

(initial barn size)/(initial number of pigs) = (increased barn size)/(increased number of pigs)

800/64 = 1200/86

To find the value of ""x,"" we can cross-multiply and solve for it:

800 * 86 = 1200 * 64 + 1200 * x

68,800 = 76,800 + 1200x

1200x = 76,800 - 68,800

1200x = 8,000

x = 8,000/1200

x = 6.67

Rounding to a whole number, we find that approximately 7 additional pigs came to join them in the barn."
"In the classroom, there are 7 students. Each student is given an egg to hold. The total number of eggs in the classroom is 56, weighing 1 ounce each. However, 3 more students join the class and each student is given an egg to hold. The total number of eggs in the classroom is now 10, weighing 1.5 ounces each. If the eggs are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?",8,"
Let's break down the information given:

Initially, there are 7 students in the classroom, and each student is given an egg. The total number of eggs in the classroom is 56, and each egg weighs 1 ounce.

Afterward, 3 more students join the class, and each student is given an additional egg. The total number of eggs in the classroom is now 10, and each egg weighs 1.5 ounces.

To find out how many eggs each student gets, we need to determine the number of eggs after the additional students joined and divide it by the total number of students.

Initially, there are 7 students, and each student holds 1 egg, so the total number of eggs is 7 * 1 = 7 eggs.

After the additional students joined, the total number of students becomes 7 + 3 = 10.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs in the classroom after the additional students joined. We know that the total weight of the eggs is 10 eggs * 1.5 ounces per egg = 15 ounces.

Since each egg weighs 1.5 ounces, the total number of eggs can be calculated by dividing the total weight by the weight per egg: 15 ounces / 1.5 ounces per egg = 10 eggs.

So, the number of eggs in the classroom after the additional students joined is also 10 eggs.

Finally, we divide the total number of eggs (10 eggs) by the number of students (10 students) to find out how many eggs each student gets: 10 eggs / 10 students = 1 egg.

Therefore, each student gets 1 egg."
"Martha is inviting 4 friends to a party. She has 12 cookies. Each of her friends brings a bottle of wine, so now there are 8 bottles of wine on the table.  How many cookies will each friend get?",3,"Martha is inviting 4 friends to a party, and she has 12 cookies. To find out how many cookies each friend will get, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of friends.

Martha has 12 cookies, and she is sharing them with 4 friends. Therefore, the total number of cookies per friend would be 12 cookies / 4 friends = 3 cookies.

So each friend will get 3 cookies.

The number of bottles of wine on the table doesn't affect the calculation of how many cookies each friend will get. It only provides additional information about the presence of wine at the party."
"During a science lab, Kenji and his classmates were placing colored blocks on a scale. The yellow block weighed 0.6 pounds and the green block weighed 0.4 pounds. They continued to place blocks on the scale until it reached a weight of 3 kilograms. The yellow block then weighed 0.9 kilograms and the green block weighed 0.6 kilograms. How much more did the yellow block weigh than the green block?",0.2,"To compare the weight difference between the yellow block and the green block, we need to convert the weights to the same unit of measurement. In this case, we'll convert everything to kilograms.

Given information:
Yellow block weight initially: 0.6 pounds
Green block weight initially: 0.4 pounds
Yellow block weight after adding more blocks: 0.9 kilograms
Green block weight after adding more blocks: 0.6 kilograms

To convert pounds to kilograms, we use the conversion factor 1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms.

Initial yellow block weight in kilograms: 0.6 pounds * 0.453592 kilograms/pound ≈ 0.2721552 kilograms
Initial green block weight in kilograms: 0.4 pounds * 0.453592 kilograms/pound ≈ 0.1814368 kilograms

The weight difference between the yellow block and the green block after adding more blocks:
Yellow block weight after adding more blocks - Green block weight after adding more blocks
= 0.9 kilograms - 0.6 kilograms
= 0.3 kilograms

Therefore, the yellow block weighs 0.3 kilograms more than the green block."
"Albert's cabbage patch has 12 rows of cabbage. In each row, there are 15 heads of cabbage. On average, cabbages can weigh 50 grams each. The total weight of Albert's cabbages is 2500 grams as there was a drought. How many heads of cabbage does Albert have in  all?",180,"To determine the total number of cabbage heads Albert has, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of heads in each row.

Given information:
Number of rows: 12
Number of heads in each row: 15

Total number of cabbage heads: Number of rows * Number of heads in each row

The school is planning a field trip for the 14 students. The school has arranged for buses that each have 2 seats. The weight capacity of a bus is 1500 kilograms. Students weigh between 30 and 80 kilograms each. How many buses are needed to take the trip?,7,"To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to consider both the seating capacity and the weight capacity of the buses.

Given information:
Number of students: 14
Seating capacity of each bus: 2 seats
Weight capacity of each bus: 1500 kilograms
Weight range of each student: 30 kilograms to 80 kilograms

First, let's determine the maximum number of students that can be accommodated by the seating capacity of the buses. Since each bus has 2 seats, the maximum number of students per bus is 2.

Number of buses based on seating capacity: Number of students / Maximum number of students per bus
= 14 students / 2 students per bus
= 7 buses

Now, let's consider the weight capacity of the buses. We need to calculate the total weight of the students and ensure it is within the weight capacity of the buses.

Minimum weight of each student: 30 kilograms
Maximum weight of each student: 80 kilograms

To calculate the minimum and maximum total weight of the students, we multiply the respective weights by the number of students:

Minimum total weight: 14 students * 30 kilograms per student = 420 kilograms
Maximum total weight: 14 students * 80 kilograms per student = 1120 kilograms

Since the weight capacity of each bus is 1500 kilograms, the total weight of the students falls within the weight capacity of a single bus.

Therefore, considering both the seating capacity and weight capacity, only 1 bus is needed for the field trip."
"Scarlett's measuring cup contains 0.16666666666666666 cup of oil. It takes her 2 minutes to pour this quantity in. If Scarlett adds 0.6666666666666666 additional oil to the cup and it takes her 30 seconds to do so, then how much oil will be in the measuring cup ? ",0.833333333,"
To calculate the total amount of oil in the measuring cup, we can add the initial quantity of oil to the additional oil that Scarlett pours.

Given information:
Initial quantity of oil: 0.16666666666666666 cup
Additional oil: 0.6666666666666666 cup

To find the total amount of oil, we add the initial quantity to the additional oil:
Total amount of oil = Initial quantity of oil + Additional oil
= 0.16666666666666666 cup + 0.6666666666666666 cup
= 0.8333333333333333 cup

"In the drawer, there are 11 rulers and 34 crayons. The drawer is 80 percent full. Tim added 14 larger rulers to the drawer. The drawer becomes 95 percent full. How many rulers are now there in all ? ",25,"Let's calculate the initial number of rulers in the drawer.

Given information:
Number of rulers initially: 11
Percentage full initially: 80%

To find the actual capacity of the drawer, we divide the number of rulers by the percentage full:
Actual capacity of the drawer = Number of rulers initially / (Percentage full initially / 100)
= 11 / (80 / 100)
= 11 / 0.8
= 13.75 rulers

Since the actual capacity of the drawer is 13.75 rulers, we can conclude that the drawer can hold 13 rulers (rounded down to the nearest whole number) without being considered full.

Now let's consider the additional rulers that Tim added to the drawer.

Given information:
Number of additional rulers: 14
Percentage full after adding rulers: 95%

To find the total capacity of the drawer after adding the rulers, we can divide the number of rulers by the new percentage full:
Total capacity of the drawer = Number of rulers / (Percentage full after adding rulers / 100)
= 13 + 14 / (95 / 100)
= 27 / 0.95
≈ 28.42 rulers

Since the total capacity of the drawer is approximately 28.42 rulers, we can conclude that there are now 28 rulers (rounded down to the nearest whole number) in total after Tim added the additional rulers.

Therefore, there are now 28 rulers in all."
"Dan had 7 potatoes and 4 cantaloupes in the garden. The rabbits ate 4 of the potatoes, and gained 5 pounds per potato. The cantaloupes in the garden weigh 2 pounds each, and Dan plans to sell 8 pounds worth of cantaloupes. How many potatoes does Dan now have ? ",3,"Let's calculate the number of potatoes Dan has after the rabbits ate some of them.

Given information:
Initial number of potatoes: 7
Potatoes eaten by rabbits: 4

Subtracting the number of potatoes eaten by the rabbits from the initial number of potatoes gives us the current number of potatoes:
Current number of potatoes = Initial number of potatoes - Potatoes eaten by rabbits

Therefore, Dan now has 3 potatoes.

The weight of each potato is not relevant to the calculation since the information provided only mentions the number of potatoes eaten and not their individual weights."
"The junior ranger asked Christian to help him place 420 seedlings in packets which weigh 60 grams. At the end of the endeavour, the total weight of the packets with seedlings is 80 grams.  If every packet needs to contain 7 seeds, how many packets do they need?",60,"
To find the number of packets needed, we need to consider the total weight of the packets with seedlings and the weight of each packet.

Given information:
Total weight of packets with seedlings: 80 grams
Weight of each packet: 60 grams
Number of seeds per packet: 7

To determine the number of packets, we can divide the total weight of the packets with seedlings by the weight of each packet:
Number of packets = Total weight of packets with seedlings / Weight of each packet
= 80 grams / 60 grams
= 1.33 packets

Since we can't have a fraction of a packet, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they would need 2 packets.

Hence, they would need 2 packets to accommodate the 420 seedlings."
"Stephanie went to the store 8 times last month. This month, she has decided to go to the store 12 times. She buys 2 oranges each time she goes to the store. She plans to buy 3 apples each time she goes to the store.  How many oranges did Stephanie buy last month?",16,"Last month, Stephanie went to the store 8 times, buying 2 oranges each time.

"Sara has saved 11 quarters from washing cars. She decided to use them all to buy candy from the vending machine, which cost 75 cents per candy. After buying the candies, she has 2 dollars and 34 cents left in her pocket.  How many cents did Sara earn during car washing?",275,"
To find out how many cents Sara earned from car washing, we need to calculate the total value of the quarters she saved.

Given information:
Number of quarters saved: 11
Cost of candy per piece: 75 cents
Amount of money left in her pocket after buying candy: 2 dollars and 34 cents

To calculate the total value of the quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

Total value of quarters = Number of quarters * Value of each quarter
= 11 quarters * 25 cents per quarter
= 275 cents

Now, to determine the amount of money Sara earned from car washing, we subtract the total value of the quarters from the amount of money left in her pocket:

Amount earned from car washing = Amount of money left in pocket - Total value of quarters
= (2 dollars * 100 cents/dollar + 34 cents) - 275 cents
= 200 cents + 34 cents - 275 cents
= -41 cents

From the calculation, we can see that the result is negative, indicating that Sara did not earn any money from car washing. Instead, she spent more on candy than the value of the quarters she had saved.

Therefore, Sara did not earn any cents from car washing."

Total time spent = Time spent at 2 kilometers per hour + Time spent at 1 kilometer per hour
= 2 hours + 0 hours
= 2 hours

Therefore, Jose wandered for 2 hours."
"There were a total of 27 soccer games during the 3 month season. Each game lasted for 90 minutes. As the season progressed, the players became more experienced and the duration of each game increased to 100 minutes.   If the games are equally divided, how many soccer games are played a month ?",9,"To determine the number of soccer games played in a month, we need to divide the total number of games by the number of months.

Given information:
Total number of soccer games: 27
Duration of each game initially: 90 minutes
Duration of each game later: 100 minutes
Number of months in the season: 3

To calculate the number of soccer games played in a month, we divide the total number of games by the number of months:

Number of soccer games per month = Total number of soccer games / Number of months
= 27 games / 3 months
= 9 games per month

Therefore, there are 9 soccer games played in a month."
"Sam had 98 pennies saved up in his bank. 6 of these are historical pennies. He spent 93 of them buying a candy bar at the store, including 3 of his historical pennies. How many pennies does he have now ?",5,"To find out how many pennies Sam has left after spending on the candy bar, we need to subtract the number of pennies spent from the total number of pennies he had initially.

Given information:
Total number of pennies Sam had: 98
Number of historical pennies he had: 6
Number of pennies spent on the candy bar: 93
Number of historical pennies spent: 3

To calculate the number of pennies Sam has left, we subtract the number of pennies spent from the total number of pennies:

Total number of pennies left = Total number of pennies - Number of pennies spent
= 98 - 93
= 5

Therefore, Sam has 5 pennies left."
"In the lunchroom, each table had 6 students sitting around it. The average weight of a student is 60 kg. There are 34 tables. The table can take 180 kg weight atop it before it breaks. How many students were sitting in the lunchroom?",204,"To determine the number of students sitting in the lunchroom, we need to calculate the total weight on the tables and divide it by the average weight of a student.

Given information:
Number of students per table: 6
Average weight of a student: 60 kg
Number of tables: 34
Maximum weight the table can take: 180 kg

To calculate the total weight on the tables, we multiply the number of students per table by the average weight of a student and then multiply it by the number of tables:

Total weight on the tables = Number of students per table * Average weight of a student * Number of tables
= 6 * 60 kg * 34
= 12,240 kg

To calculate the number of students, we divide the total weight on the tables by the average weight of a student:

Number of students = Total weight on the tables / Average weight of a student
= 12,240 kg / 60 kg
= 204 students

Therefore, there were 204 students sitting in the lunchroom."
"Nicole found an orange caterpillar and a green caterpillar in her backyard. The green caterpillar was 3 inches long and the orange caterpillar was 1.1666666666666667 inches long. After one day of munching on leaves, the green caterpillar grew to 3.5 centimeters while the orange caterpillar grew to 4.5 centimeters. How much longer was the green caterpillar than the orange caterpillar to start with?",1.833333333,"To find out how much longer the green caterpillar was than the orange caterpillar initially, we need to calculate the difference in length between the two caterpillars.

Given information:
Length of the green caterpillar initially: 3 inches
Length of the orange caterpillar initially: 1.1666666666666667 inches
Length of the green caterpillar after growth: 3.5 centimeters
Length of the orange caterpillar after growth: 4.5 centimeters

First, we need to convert the lengths of the caterpillars to the same unit for comparison. Let's convert inches to centimeters.

1 inch = 2.54 centimeters

Length of the green caterpillar initially in centimeters = 3 inches * 2.54 centimeters/inch = 7.62 centimeters
Length of the orange caterpillar initially in centimeters = 1.1666666666666667 inches * 2.54 centimeters/inch = 2.958333333333333 centimeters

Now, we can calculate the difference in length between the green and orange caterpillars:

Difference in length = Length of the green caterpillar initially - Length of the orange caterpillar initially
= 7.62 centimeters - 2.958333333333333 centimeters
= 4.661666666666667 centimeters

Therefore, the green caterpillar was initially 4.661666666666667 centimeters longer than the orange caterpillar."
"It takes 4 feet of cotton to make a tee-shirt. If I weave the cotton at a rate of 6 feet per minute, I will have enough cotton to make 10 tee-shirts in 30 minutes. How many tee-shirts can be made with 60 feet of material?",15,"To determine how many tee-shirts can be made with 60 feet of material, we need to calculate the number of tee-shirts that can be made using a given length of cotton.

Given information:
Length of cotton required for a tee-shirt: 4 feet
Rate of weaving cotton: 6 feet per minute
Time available: 30 minutes
Length of cotton available: 60 feet

To calculate the number of tee-shirts, we divide the available length of cotton by the length of cotton required for each tee-shirt:

Number of tee-shirts = Length of cotton available / Length of cotton required for each tee-shirt
= 60 feet / 4 feet
= 15 tee-shirts

Therefore, with 60 feet of material, you can make 15 tee-shirts."
"The science class researching the movement of the nearby fault line found that it moved 1.25 inches during the past year and 5.25 inches the year before. The temperature during the past year was 70 degrees Celsius and during the year before, it was 65 degrees Celsius.  How far did the fault line move in all?",6.5,"To determine the total distance the fault line moved, we need to sum up the distances it moved during the past year and the year before.

Given information:
Distance the fault line moved during the past year: 1.25 inches
Distance the fault line moved the year before: 5.25 inches

Total distance the fault line moved = Distance during the past year + Distance the year before
= 1.25 inches + 5.25 inches
= 6.5 inches

Therefore, the fault line moved a total distance of 6.5 inches."
"In Haley's class, there are 5 boys who love to play marbles. During the recess, they played for 20 minutes and managed to get 78 marbles in total.  If Haley has 35 marbles, how many will each of the boys receive?",7,"To determine how many marbles each of the boys will receive, we need to divide the total number of marbles they collected during recess by the number of boys.

Given information:
Number of boys: 5
Total number of marbles collected during recess: 78

Number of marbles each boy will receive = Total number of marbles / Number of boys
= 78 marbles / 5 boys
= 15.6 marbles

Since we can't have a fraction of a marble, we can round down the result to the nearest whole number.

Each boy will receive 15 marbles.

Therefore, each of the boys will receive 15 marbles."
"Marilyn has 40 bananas that must be put away in boxes. Daniel comes to help and brings 10 cookies to share with Marilyn. After they finish eating, they start to pack the bananas. Each banana weight 12 grams. At the end of the packing, Daniel and Marilyn lose an average of 10 grams each. If there are 8 boxes, how many bananas must go in each box?",5,"To determine how many bananas must go in each box, we need to divide the total weight of the bananas by the number of boxes.

Given information:
Total number of bananas: 40
Weight of each banana: 12 grams
Number of boxes: 8

Total weight of the bananas = Number of bananas * Weight of each banana
= 40 bananas * 12 grams/banana
= 480 grams

After Daniel and Marilyn lose an average of 10 grams each, the total weight decreases by (10 + 10) grams = 20 grams.

Adjusted total weight of the bananas = Total weight of the bananas - Weight lost
= 480 grams - 20 grams
= 460 grams

Number of bananas in each box = Adjusted total weight of the bananas / Number of boxes
= 460 grams / 8 boxes
= 57.5 grams

Since we can't have a fraction of a banana, we can round down the result to the nearest whole number.

Each box should have 57 bananas.
